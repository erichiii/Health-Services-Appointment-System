                Welcome to Village East Clinic, the dedicated health service portal of Village East Executive Homes, located in Barangay Sto. Domingo, Cainta, Rizal. Our clinic was established with one goal in mind: to bring quality, accessible, and community-focused healthcare closer to every resident.

                Over the years, Village East Clinic has grown alongside the community it serves. From humble beginnings as a basic health post, we've expanded our services and reachâ€”adapting to the evolving needs of our barangay. This website is a continuation of that growth: a step forward in making health services more efficient and accessible for all.
